    Nat.toText(m);
  };
 
}
```

5. What is wrong with the following code?
```
actor {
  var languages : [var Text] = ["English", "German", "Chinese", "Japanese", "French"];

  public func show_languages(language : Text) : async [var Text] {
    return (languages);
  };
 
}
```

**Answer 5:  Need to remove the var from [var Text]**

6. What is wrong with the following code?
```
actor {
  var languages : [Text] = ["English", "German", "Chinese", "Japanese", "French"];

  public func add_language(new_language: Text) : async [Text] {
    languages := Array.append<Text>(languages, [new_language]);
    return (languages);
  };
 
}
```

**Answer 6:  Need to import Array from base as well as Buffer. For performance issues is better to create a Buffer, add all the values of the array in a loop then add the new_language and convert Buffer.toArray in the return**
